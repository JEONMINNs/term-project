## How to implement it
---
#### 1. Install a library
 You must install the cv2 and dlib libraries used by the code. You can install it using the commands below.
> pip install opencv-python
> pip install dlib
#### 2. Download **shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat**
 You can download it http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
 After downloading, unzip it, place it in the same directory as the script, or specify the file path directly to the script.  

#### 3. Check webcam
 The code uses the default camera (cv2.VideoCapture(0)). Make sure the webcam is working properly.
#### 4. Run code
Run code using idle. Running opens the opencv window and presses 'q' to end.
